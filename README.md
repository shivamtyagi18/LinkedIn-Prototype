Did node backend react frontend kafka backend installations and created the folder structures for the same.

Created database linkedin  also in mlab and db files are present there.

everyone clone this and start working inside linkedincontroller and create a file for their module and start creating api requests.( route handler folder will contain route for index.js for all) 
similarly for kafka backend create corresponding routes by creating folder inside services for your module.

Shivam please merge my commits
